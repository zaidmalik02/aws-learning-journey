# Day 12 â€“ Document Databases & DynamoDB  

## What I Learned  
- **Document Databases**:  
  - Store data as JSON-like documents instead of rows and columns.  
  - Ideal for semi-structured data such as user profiles, product catalogs, and CMS systems.  
  - Learned about **Amazon DocumentDB** (MongoDB-compatible) and its use cases.  

- **Key-Value Databases**:  
  - Simple data model with unique keys mapping to specific values.  
  - Offers high-speed lookups and scalability.  
  - Suitable for caching, session management, and gaming leaderboards.  

- **Amazon DynamoDB**:  
  - Fully managed NoSQL database service.  
  - Supports both **key-value** and **document** data models.  
  - Automatically scales throughput capacity.  
  - Offers **on-demand capacity** and **provisioned throughput** modes.  
  - Integrated with AWS services like Lambda, API Gateway, and CloudWatch.  

## Steps I Did  
1. Reviewed the fundamentals of **Document Databases** and their use cases.  
2. Learned about **Key-Value Databases** and real-world applications.  
3. Explored **Amazon DynamoDB console** and created a sample table.  
4. Experimented with **inserting, querying, and scanning items** in DynamoDB.  
5. Observed how DynamoDB handles read/write capacity and data indexing.  

## Output  
- Successfully created and interacted with a DynamoDB table.  
- Gained hands-on understanding of **NoSQL database concepts** in AWS.  
- Learned how DynamoDB integrates with other AWS services for scalability and automation.
