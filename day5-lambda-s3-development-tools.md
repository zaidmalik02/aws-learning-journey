# Day 5 – AWS Lambda, Development Tools & S3  

## What I Learned  
- **AWS Computing & Serverless**  
  - **AWS Lambda** – running code without provisioning servers  
  - Other computing concepts:  
    - **Amazon Lightsail** – simplified virtual private servers  
    - **AWS Batch** – batch processing jobs  

- **Development Tools & Services**  
  - **AWS Cloud9** – cloud-based IDE  
  - **AWS Cloud Shell / CLI** – command-line management  
  - **AWS Amplify** – developing and deploying web/mobile apps  
  - **AWS CodeArtifact** – artifact repository for development  

- **Object Storage (S3)**  
  - Creating S3 buckets and uploading resources  
  - Understanding **storage classes**:  
    - Standard, Standard-IA, One Zone-IA  
    - Glacier, Deep Glacier  
    - Intelligent Tiering  
  - Basics of bucket permissions and access control  

- **Pricing Concepts**  
  - Storage costs for different classes  
  - Understanding cost optimization strategies for S3  

## Steps I Did  
1. Explored **AWS Lambda** and understood serverless computing concepts.  
2. Reviewed **Amazon Lightsail** and **AWS Batch**.  
3. Practiced development tools: **Cloud9, Cloud Shell, Amplify, CodeArtifact**.  
4. Created an **S3 bucket**, uploaded sample folders and files.  
5. Learned about **S3 storage classes** and their use cases.  
6. Studied **pricing elements** for storage and cost optimization.  

## Output  
- Successfully created an **S3 bucket** and uploaded resources.  
- Learned to use multiple **AWS developer tools** for cloud development.  
- Understood **serverless computing with Lambda**.  
- Gained knowledge of **S3 storage classes and pricing** for real-world applications.
