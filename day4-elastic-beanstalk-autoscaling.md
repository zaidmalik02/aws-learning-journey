# Day 4 â€“ Elastic Beanstalk, Auto Scaling & Target Groups  

## What I Learned  
- **Elastic Beanstalk**:  
  - How to create an application and environment  
  - Configuring environment settings (platform, instance type, scaling options)  
  - Deploying and managing applications  
  - Terminating environments and deleting applications (cleanup best practices)  

- **Auto Scaling Groups**:  
  - How they work with EC2 instances  
  - Connecting Auto Scaling Groups to Target Groups  
  - Scaling in/out based on demand  

- **Target Groups & Load Balancers** (review):  
  - Routing traffic to EC2 instances  
  - Associating Auto Scaling Groups with Target Groups  

## Steps I Did  
1. Reviewed previous session on Elastic Beanstalk and setup that was incomplete.  
2. Created a new **Elastic Beanstalk application and environment**.  
3. Configured **Auto Scaling Groups** and connected them to a **Target Group**.  
4. Tested deployment and verified traffic routing through the Load Balancer.  
5. Practiced **terminating the environment** and **deleting the application**.  
6. Cleaned up resources to avoid unnecessary AWS charges.  

## Output  
- Successfully deployed an application via Elastic Beanstalk.  
- Auto Scaling Groups connected to Target Groups and handled traffic correctly.  
- Learned how to **delete environments and applications safely**.  
- Gained hands-on experience with AWS resource management and cleanup.
