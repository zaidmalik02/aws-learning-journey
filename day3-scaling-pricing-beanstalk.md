# Day 3 â€“ Scaling, Pricing Models & Elastic Beanstalk  

## What I Learned  
- **AWS Pricing Models**:  
  - On-Demand Instances  
  - Spot Instances (low-cost, spare capacity)  
  - Reserved Instances (commitment-based savings)  
  - Savings Plans (flexible cost savings)  
  - Dedicated Hosts (physical server isolation)  
- **Scaling Concepts**:  
  - Vertical Scaling (increase instance size)  
  - Horizontal Scaling (add more instances)  
- **Auto Scaling**:  
  - How Auto Scaling Groups work  
  - Launch configurations & scaling policies  
  - Scaling in/out based on demand  
- **Elastic Beanstalk**:  
  - Simplifies deployment of applications  
  - Automatically handles provisioning, scaling, and monitoring  
- **Load Balancing & Target Groups** (review):  
  - How ELB distributes traffic across multiple EC2 instances  
  - Target Groups define which EC2s receive traffic  

## Steps I Did  
1. Explored different **pricing models** and their use cases.  
2. Reviewed **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** and **Target Groups**.  
3. Learned the difference between **vertical vs horizontal scaling**.  
4. Understood **Auto Scaling Groups** and scaling triggers.  
5. Introduction to **Elastic Beanstalk** and its advantages.  

## Output  
- Gained clarity on **AWS cost optimization options**.  
- Understood when to use Spot, Reserved, or Savings Plans.  
- Practiced the **concept of scaling** and how Auto Scaling Groups manage EC2 fleets.  
- Saw how **Elastic Beanstalk** can automate application deployment.
